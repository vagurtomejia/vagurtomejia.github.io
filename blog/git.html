   <h1>What I am learning?</h1> 
   <h2>Week 1: The command line and Version Control</h2> 
   <h4>25/10/2015</h4> 
 
This is my very first post to my Github blog and I would like to be more enthusiastic about that, but it 01:00 AM on Monday, I am exhausted and I have fallen far behind on my work. So please be indulgent. I'm just trying to do the minimum necessary here. I promiss to improve the quality of the content on future posts. </p>
So, lets ask to the following tree questions based on what I have learn at DBC this week:

   <section>
   <h7>What are the benefits of version control?</h7>
   When your projects are managed using a version control system, here are some advantages that you have:
     <ul>
       <li>everyone knows what the other members of the team are doing
       <li>you can have a control of permissions
       <li>you can store the different succesives versions of the project
       <li>you can store detailed information on the logs of different versions
       <li>keep track of all the changes, so that you could go back to a working version at any time
       <li>you can experiment without messing up the final product
     </ul>

   </section>
    <h7>How does git help you keep track of changes?</h7>
     <ul>
       <li> every commited changes have an associated message wich provides information on the changes
       <li> every commit is a check point 
       <li> every changes are associated with an user
       <li> we have a list of all the files that where changed at a specific point
       <li> it´s possible to compare two different versions to see the changes
     </ul>

   <section>
   <h7>Why use GitHub to store your code?</h7>
     <ul>
       <li> it uses Git VCS (Version Control System)
       <li> it provides with remote repositories available at any time
       <li> it has features and tools usefull for collaborative work
       <li> it´s also a social coding website
 
     </ul>
