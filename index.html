    <h1>How to improve as a software developer?</h1>
    <img src="images/vitruve-tux.png" alt="a penguin as the Leonardo da Vinci's Vitruvian man">
    <p>Guess what? Software developers are just like human beings!
    </p>
    <p>
      For a couple of years now, I have learned and tested some techniques, processes and methodologies intented to be for my personal development:
    </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Open collaboration</li>
        <li><a href="nvc.html">NVC</a></li>
        <li>NLP</li>
        <li>Meditation</li>
        <li>Spirituality</li>
      </ul>
    <p>
      After all this years, it turns out that the same approaches had helped me also to be a better professional. Why? Because, unless I am mistaken, it seems to me that developers are just like humans!
    </p>
    <p>I would like to share with you some of this approaches in the next few weeks of DBC with the following schedule:
    </p>
    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Field</th>
          <th>Week</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>

    <p>Next week I am celebrating my tenth anniversary of career as a software Engineer...</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Whatever career you may choose for yourself - doctor, lawyer, teacher - let me propose an avocation to be pursued along with it. Become a dedicated fighter for civil rights. Make it a central part of your life.
      </p>
      <p>It will make you a better doctor, a better lawyer, a better teacher. It will enrich your spirit as nothing else possibly can. It will give you that rare sense of nobility that can only spring from love and selflessly helping your fellow man. Make a career of humanity. Commit yourself to the noble struggle for human rights. You will make a greater person of yourself, a greater Nation of your country and a finer world to live in.</p>

        <li>Use of non-supported element attributes such as <strong>align</strong> for the <strong>div</strong> element or <strong>target</strong> for the <strong>a element</strong></li>
